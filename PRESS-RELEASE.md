# Park Assist #

## Summary ##
  > Park Assist takes realtime data from the City of Santa Monica's parking API and creates parking suggestions for users based on the nearest available meters.

## Problem ##
  > The original application was released as a mobile-responsive web application. Given that users are most likely to use the app while en route to their destination, a fully mobile version of the app would lead to a better user experience.

## Solution ##
  > Given that the legacy codebase was written in AngularJS, the Ionic framework lent itself to rapidly prototyping a mobile application. Our team worked to create a mobile-specific UI and new features that fit the new version of the app.
